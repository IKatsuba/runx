A lightning monorepo task runner written in Deno. `runx` helps you manage and
execute tasks across multiple packages in your monorepo with minimal
configuration and maximum efficiency.

> **Note**: Supports only npm workspaces for now. Other package managers are
> planned.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with your existing monorepo
  structure
- **Smart Workspace Detection**: Automatically detects and works with workspace
  patterns defined in your root `package.json`
- **Intelligent Dependency Management**:
  - Builds and validates dependency relationships between packages
  - Detects and prevents circular dependencies
  - Executes tasks in correct topological order
- **Flexible Execution Modes**:
  - Run commands across all packages
  - Target specific packages
  - Execute only in affected packages (Git-aware)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
deno install --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run -g -N -R -n runx jsr:@runx/cli
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Navigate to your monorepo root:

```bash
cd your-monorepo
```

2. Run a script in all packages:

```bash
runx test
```

## 💡 Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run a command in all packages
runx <task-name>

# Run a command only in specific packages
runx <task-name> package1 package2

# Run a command only in affected packages (compared to main branch)
runx <task-name> --affected

# Run a command in packages affected since a specific branch
runx <task-name> --affected feature-branch
```

### Command Options

- `-a, --affected [base]` - Run command only for affected packages since the
  specified base branch (defaults to 'main')
- `--version` - Show version information
- `-h, --help` - Display help information

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Workspace Detection**: `runx` reads your root `package.json` to understand
   your workspace structure
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Builds a complete dependency graph of your packages
3. **Task Execution**:
   - Validates the dependency graph for circular dependencies
   - Determines the correct execution order
   - Executes tasks while maintaining proper working directories and environment
     variables
